# Problem Description
# Question:- There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.

#  A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side.

# What is the maximum stolen value?

# Sample Input: val[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5}

# Sample Output: 20


num = list(map(int, input().split()))
sum = num[0]
for i in range(0, len(num)//2):
    sum = sum + int(num[i])
print(sum)
